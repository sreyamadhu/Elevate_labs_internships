## 1. Password Strength Analyzer with Custom Wordlist Generator

A Python-based tool that analyzes password strength using entropy and brute-force estimation techniques. It also allows generating a custom wordlist based on user-specific data such as name, birthdate, or keywords.

- Language: Python
- Libraries: `re`, `math`, `argparse`
- Features:
  - Password entropy calculation
  - Brute-force time estimation
  - Wordlist generation based on personal inputs

## 2. Ethical Phishing Simulation Platform

A Django-based web app that simulates phishing email campaigns in an ethical and educational setting. It allows sending mock phishing emails (without real delivery), logging results, and visualizing user response.

- Language: Python (Django Framework)
- Features:
  - Admin dashboard to trigger phishing emails
  - User model for email targeting
  - Fake email simulation with logging
  - Placeholder or print-based email delivery (for safe testing)
